## Problem Domain:

Use Django REST Framework to create an API, then “containerize” it with Docker.

## Description:

This API is intended to provide images of fruit. We start with just 4 Braeburn Apples today, but once I've found a way to automate the uploading of the rest of this dataset I found I'll be able to upload the rest of the images of braeburn apples and move onto the images of all the other fruit (it's extensive).  
When I do finally have this entire dataset uploaded I'll be able to use this API to train a fruit recognition API which will advance me in my goal to create a scalable automated farm.
